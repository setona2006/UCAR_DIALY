gates_close:
  add_risk_if:
    - "US100 daily close > 25670 AND 21MA holds as support (buy pullback, no chase)"
  reduce_risk_if:
    - "US100 daily close < 23692"
    - "USDJPY daily/weekly breakdown < 154.7"
  caution:
    - "thin liquidity → wick hunts / gap moves"
    - "USDJPY weakness can hit JP beta first"
    - "BTC weakness is an accelerator, not the leader"

execution_plan:
  style:
    - "No chase buys. Wait break+hold then buy pullback."
    - "When risk-off: stop adds first, then trim high beta, keep core last."
  notes:
    - "Keep decisions close-based. Intraday wicks are noise in thin weeks."
